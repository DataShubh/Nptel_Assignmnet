Prepare the dataset further by following the steps given below: 
	●Ensure the datatypes of the columns are appropriate
	●Drop all the variables except “Area” and “Production”
	●Split the data into the train (80%) and test (20%) sets, and set the random state for the train-test split instance as 111

Build a linear regression model using the training dataset by having “Area” as the independent variable and “Production” as the dependent variable. Using the model that has been built, answer the following question.


14.What does the R-squared value calculated for the model built signify?
 The model is good as the R-squared-value is close to 1
 The model is not good as the R-squared-value is close to 0
 R-squared-value does not show the performance of the model
 R-squared-value cannot be computed with this data
Accepted Answers:
The model is not good as the R-squared-value is close to 0

15.For the model that has been built using the information given above Q14, the RMSE of the linear regression model is ___________
